## RootFounders monorepo

### Description
RootFounders is a decentralized and permission-less protocol that makes it easy to find a cofounder for your project while validating the idea at the same time.

**Find a cofounder:** Building alone is not fun, but finding a cofounder is hard. Instead of searching among random people at conferences or trying to get out of your X/Farcaster bubble, describe your idea on the platform, together with a link to a landing page, source code or MVP. Users can then apply to become a cofounder and your friends can endorse you to boost your legitimacy.

**Validating ideas:** every user can tip an already posted idea and add comments. This way founder gets first market signals and the project gets visibility (not to mention some extra money ðŸ˜‰).

### Features
**Tip**: send a tip to a project you like. Smart contract supports both Ether and ERC-20, the UI (frontend) only Ether for the time being. This functionality is implemented using OpenZeppelin's PaymentSplitter (i.e. each project has its own address for tipping).

**Comment**: comment on projects. Comment text is sent in calldata, so the user doesn't pay for it, but it's recorded on chain. It's then picked up by our worker and cached in the database. This keeps comments decentralized and not owned by us.

**Create project**: describe your idea and present it on RootFounders. Projects are saved on chain with their descriptions being pinned to IPFS. This makes it easy for anyone to own their project data and they can pin it themselves.

**Teams**: currently only supported by the smart contract, allows users to apply to join a team, be allowed to join and leave a team. These are all on-chain events.

From the technical perspective, we designed RootFounders so that anyone could build an alternative UI for it (decentralized frontends).
Users own their data (project descriptions, comments) and can perform actions even without the offical UI. This makes RootFounders truly decentralized protocol.

### Installation
You'll need to run local IPFS node, Anvil local chain and Postgres.

Deploy the contract:
```shell
cd contracts && forge script script/main.s.sol:RootFoundersScript --fork-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast
```

Create `rootfounders.toml` file that looks like this:
```toml
ipfsnode = "http://localhost:5001"
rpc = "ws://localhost:8545"
maincontract = "CONTRACT_ADDRESS"

[website]
listenurl = ":3333"

[database]
host = "localhost"
port = 5432
user = "postgres"
password = "test"
database = "rootfounders"
```

Start worker:
```shell
cd worker && go run . --config path/to/rootfounders.toml
```

Start website:
```shell
cd website && go run . --config path/to/rootfounders.toml
```

### Usage
After following all steps described in "Installation", go to `http://localhost:3333` to access the UI.

### Structure
- `src/contracts` submodule that leads to git repo containing RootFounders smart contract (Solidity)
- `src/worker` is like a cache for the smart contract: listens for events and saves data to the database (Go)

- `src/abis` contains smart contract ABI generated by go-ethereum's `abigen`
- `src/config` manages configuration (Go)
- `src/database` manages database connections (Go)
- `src/website` is RootFounders website (Server Side Rendered, Go)

- `src/frontend` contains web components needed for the UI (Typescript)
