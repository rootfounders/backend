## Architecture

### IPFS
Textual data is stored in IPFS, so users can get it permissionlessly.

### Arbitrum
Smart contract functions as a decentralized database and source of truth for the rest of the app.

### Worker
Worker listens for event from the smart contract and caches the data in the database, so the frontend is loading fast.

### Database
PostgreSQL database that functions as a cache.

### Website
Mostly static, server rendered website. The reason is that projects will need good SEO in order to build awareness.

### Frontend
As HTML is generated by `website` Go package, frontend is just a collection of web components needed for interactions
with the user and their wallet.
